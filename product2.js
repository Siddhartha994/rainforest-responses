I was pleased by the picture quality in first I expected a smooth software from oneplus but TV operation is bit slow probably due to 1gb ram and lower clocked processor. Can't complaint at this price point. Wish oneplus would release better optimized software in update. Software update was one of my reason to buy TV from oneplus. Response from the bluetooth remote was bit slow. But hold bluetooth was very functional. Might be as it is bluetooth 5.0, TV was able to connect to 3+ devices at a time. 1 mobile, 1 bluetooth speaker and remote. That's great. Coming to sound, Speaker quality isn't upto mark. You have multiple options to enhance audio (dolby, surround, presets, dialogue enhancer etc) probably that's the reason oneplus skipped 3.5mm output and opted for optical and HDMI ARC ports to provide quality auido output on external speaker. You should go RCA audio adapters if you want 3.5mm input else connect to speakers using bluetooth adapter. That would cost additional if you want to. If you look for picture quality, minimal design and stick to few ott app this TV is for you. For power users and those who use only 3.5 jack to connect speakers look else where.  Update : Oneplus released major update and UI and remote control navigation seems improved now. But setup of new Bluetooth connection got buggy. Im not able to connect to new devices.

Here is a list of issues with your product. 1. connected to Samsung mobile through google home as the tv isn't connecting through Samsung smart view. always says unable to connect, try again. And even through the google home, it is struggling too much to even cast the photos and forget about casting the videos. 2. Neither windows nor Mac is recognising The tv in wireless mode. Had to use third party app from play store to Airplay my Mac n gues what, windows is not recognising the tv. It is really shocking to see Mac recognised where Windows couldn’t (using third party play store app). 3. To my bad, even through third party play store app, it is laggy half of the times. 4. And how can I ignore to say about Oneplus connect app, Its a wonders**t app, do the gesture wait for couple of seconds and then it responds and you can’t access files through the connect app on this tv. 5. And sound, it has options by the name, dolby Audio and Dolby digital plus, fix this in your mind, these two features are just names and these does change the sound experience by zero percentage. 6. On Youtube, video quality is limited to 1080p, best to use HDMi cable to your happy and play 4K, only then it felt better than any other video quality experience of this tv. 7. Opening and closing apps, is like suspense thriller movie scene experience, you will be waiting to know when it will respond.sometimes suspense extends to 3-10 seconds. 8. Viewing angles? acceptable for this price. 9. Colors? Green is worst of all and then red , black is good, blue colors are worst, yellows are good and the rest that you find are acceptable. 10. Display quality? If any of you ever used the Chinese phones of the last decade, you will get the exact same feeling. I promise you this. 11. Best option to put good use of display and colors is to use pen drive, hard disk or HDMI and play the 4k or full HD videos. This is the only way that this display can make you happy. 12. And the remote, the menu button literally never worked on any app nor on home page. It just exists with void function assigned to it. 13. Almost forgot about voice search that is google assistance, 10 out of 10 times, it took 3-10 seconds to launch it. 14. Opening an app, Fix in your mind that it will take at least 3-10. 15. Once you connect Bluetooth accessory, you have to remove the device from the list, if you want to connect it to other device. you will not have an option to disconnect.Read more",

I recommend you guys to mount it on the wall as the 55 variant will not be bear any wind blast in the room. This happened with me when I installed it on the date of delivery and the guy came and recommended us to mount on TV. The guys who came to install was really kind hearted and no sign of foolishness was seen  EDIT: A lot of you are saying this lags a lot.IT LAGS WHEN THE INTERNET CONNECTION IS SLOW.
